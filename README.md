# Website design #    


**What does this application do?**

This is an example of well design website with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is supposed to represent some of the skills that I possess in website design. During the creaton of this site, I used IntelliJ to coordinate and organise the files as well as write the code. Websites such as Google fonts, Fontello or Subtle Patterns (links to them below) were used in order to enchance the overall look and feel of the website.
