# Website design #    


**What does this application do?**

This is an example of well design website with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is supposed to represent some of the skills that I possess in website design. During the creaton of this site, I used IntelliJ to coordinate and organise the files as well as write the code. Websites such as Google fonts, Fontello or Subtle Patterns (links to them below) were used in order to enchance the overall look and feel of the website.

Fontello        - http://fontello.com/

**Biggest challenges I've encountered**

The second biggest challenge I had to tackle in this project was the arrangement of multiple segments of the website layout overlaying each other. This led to demotivation since it was extremely frustrating to fix even the smallest problem. This however, led to the biggest challenge I've encountered during this project - my own resilience. During this project, there was a lot of moments when there was nothing I wanted more, than to just quit and never come back to it. But I pushed through them which I believe is a valuable lesson for any future employee.

**What did I learn?**

I learned how to manage my motivation in moments, when everything seems to fall apart. That moment when it seems almost like the entire universe works against us (or at least our computer). Those are the moments that are the hardest to deal with and I believe that I am capable of doing just that.
